Using cameras, microphones, and state of the art facial recognition, natural language processing, and speech to text software, Echo is able recognize familiar and new faces allowing patients to confidently meet new people and learn more about the world around them.

When Echo hears an introduction being made, it uses its camera to continuously train itself to recognize the person. Then, if it sees the person again it'll notify its owner that the acquaintance is there. Echo also has a button that, when pressed, will contact the authorities- this way, if the owner is in danger, help is one tap away.
